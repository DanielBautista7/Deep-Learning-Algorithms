# Deep Learning Algorithms

This folder is a compilation of deep learning algorithms I've implemented with numpy as part of the first two courses in the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera:
1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization

These include multilayer feedforward networks, regularizations (dropout, L2), and optimizaion algorithms (gradient descent, momentum, adam).
